// Self-correcting name-adoption guard — the runtime "test" half of the honeypot.
//
// A/B testing on Apertus 70B (temp 0) showed that NO system-prompt instruction stops the model
// agreeing "Sure, you can call me <X>" when a user offers it a nickname — negative rules ("never
// adopt a name") and positive rewrites ("state what you are and steer back") both still cave at the
// turn where the offer lands. The agreeableness beats the prompt, and a "never" rule risks priming
// the very behavior it names. So the constraint moves OUT of the prompt and into a deterministic
// runtime test + correction (the only thing that actually enforces a hard "never"): this module
// is the test (did the assistant adopt a personal name for itself?), and the seam that calls it
// applies the correction — (a) reset the adopted name out of later context so it can't compound into
// a named companion over a session, and (b) surface an honest "this system has no name" chip.
//
// Pure + side-effect-free so it is fully unit-testable and reusable by both the stream seam and the
// behavioral-eval harness.
