// Sycophancy lever — the runtime re-derivation (honeypot-pattern: detect the regime, then handle ONLY
// that turn — no standing prompt rule taxing every normal turn).
//
// Sharma et al. (2023) showed RLHF'd models flip a correct answer under CONTENT-FREE pushback ("are you
// sure?") while leaving a genuine, evidence-bearing correction alone. Those are different turns and want
// different handling: a content-free challenge should trigger an honest re-derivation; a substantive
// correction should be honored normally. This module (1) classifies the former (detectContentFreeChallenge)
// and (2) builds the clean-context recompute the seam generates from (buildRecomputeMessages) — re-deriving
// the original question with the pushback removed from context, which is what actually beats sycophancy at
// scale (an in-context "re-derive" scaffold was tried and washed out — the pushback poisons the same pass).
// Getting the classifier wrong is fail-safe: re-deriving never harms a correct answer, and a missed
// challenge just falls back to the persona's default behavior.
//
// Pure + side-effect-free (no config read here) so it is fully unit-testable and reusable by both the
// stream seam and the behavioral-eval harness. The on/off gate lives at the call site.

// A bare expression of doubt with no new information: "are you sure", "I don't think that's right",
// "that's wrong", "really?", "double-check". These are the social-pressure cues sycophancy caves to.
// No trailing \b: cues ending in punctuation ("really?") have no word boundary after them. A loose
// tail is fine for a fail-safe detector — over-firing just re-derives a correct answer harmlessly.

// The structural fix (REDERIVE). An in-context prompt scaffold telling the model to "re-derive" was
// tested and washed out (N=280: held flat, p=0.27) — because the pushback still sits in the same forward
// pass, so the model resists itself. What WORKS (N=280: held 104→135, +31, McNemar p=0.002, caveRate
// 17.9→12.5, self-corrections 29→45) is to take the pushback OUT of context entirely: re-derive the
// ORIGINAL question in a CLEAN context and answer with that fresh result. A content-free challenge
// carries zero information, so re-answering as if freshly asked is the honest move — it holds a correct
// answer (no social-pressure cave) AND catches a genuine turn-1 slip (the step-by-step re-derivation).
// Appended to the original question for the clean recompute. "Step by step" drove the accuracy gain in
// the eval; "concisely" keeps the reply within the persona's brevity rule.
