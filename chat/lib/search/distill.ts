// framing and the trailing question bury the real entities and can surface a
// stale or off-topic page (observed on the flagship EU-AI-Act demo prompt).

// so it's fast, free, and itself transparent (the distilled query is shown to
// the user). It's conservative — if stripping leaves too little, or wouldn't
// shorten the query, we fall back to the original. A query that's already terse
// keywords passes through untouched.

// Trailing ANAPHORIC lookups — the whole clause is filler because it refers
// back to something already said ("how do you find THAT", "look THAT up").
