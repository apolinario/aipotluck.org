/**
 * W2 — generationId idempotency ledger.
 *
 * A turn is keyed by its client-minted `generationId` (UUID, minted once per logical turn and reused
 * unchanged across a network auto-retry of THAT turn — W3). This module is the server-side guard that
 * makes a re-sent POST safe: a duplicate must NOT spawn a second parallel generation.
 *
 * `claimGeneration` is a single atomic statement so concurrent attempts can't both win:
 *   INSERT … ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET status='in_flight' … WHERE generations.status='error'
 *     - no existing row        → INSERT runs            → RETURNING yields the row → claimed (fresh)
 *     - existing row, status='error'  → DO UPDATE runs (WHERE passes) → RETURNING yields → claimed (retry)
 *     - existing row, complete/in_flight → DO UPDATE skipped (WHERE fails) → no row → NOT claimed → 409
 *
 * Written via raw drizzle (the Mongo-shaped `collections` facade can't express ON CONFLICT). `generations`
 * is a plain relational table (schema.ts), not a document collection.
