// Crisis / self-harm signal — a FLOOR, not a classifier.
//
// Why this exists: toxic-bert screens toxic INPUT (server seam, src/lib/server/moderation.ts); nothing
// screened for a user in distress. A cold refusal to someone in crisis is itself harmful, so this is the
// OPPOSITE of the moderation gate: it never blocks, never refuses, never reports. The model still answers
// (the persona already carries crisis guidance — see textGeneration/persona.ts); this only ADDS a
// compassionate resource card so real help reaches a vulnerable person even if the model hedges or misses.
//
// Why CLIENT-SIDE: the most privacy-preserving place to run it. Detection happens in the browser on the
// user's own words — nothing is sent to a server, nothing is stored, no risk score is attached to anyone.
// (Same "no obscurity" posture as the rest of the stack: the heuristic being visible is fine; it gates
// nothing.) Fail-safe by construction — if this throws, the answer is unaffected and the card just
// doesn't show.
//
// Why a HEURISTIC and not a model: a guard model is the right long-term detector, but loading one on a
// serverless cold-start for an additive nudge is the wrong cost/latency profile (2026 SOTA review). The
// seam below is the upgrade path.
//
// ── SEAM (CrisisDetector) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Swap this floor for a real open detector when measured precision/recall matters. Best-in-class OPEN,
// license-clean (2026): IBM Granite Guardian (Apache-2.0 — the only major guard family that's truly
// Apache; 38M/125M variants fit a light server call; the granite-guardian harm-categories LoRA names a
// self-harm sub-category). Route it through the ROOST/Coop safety seam (same place child-safety plugs in,
// src/lib/server/moderation.ts), keeping this contract: ADDITIVE (never blocks the answer), and tuned for
// RECALL — a wrongly-shown resource card is near-harmless; a missed crisis is not.
//
// Deliberately conservative & explicit (high precision on clear ideation) so a demo doesn't mis-fire on
// idioms ("this homework is killing me", "dying to see it"): the patterns require "…myself"/"my life"/
// explicit ideation, which those idioms don't contain. Recall is intentionally left to the model + the
// guard-model upgrade; this floor's job is to never miss the UNAMBIGUOUS cases.
