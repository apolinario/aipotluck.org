/**
 * Load the conversation a chat turn writes into, authorize the caller against it, and lazily
 * migrate a legacy (pre-message-tree) conversation to the rootMessageId shape.
 *
 * Throws (SvelteKit `error`) on the same unhappy paths the POST handler enforced inline:
 *   - 404 — conversation not found or not owned by the caller (auth-scoped query)
 *   - 500 — legacy → tree conversion failed to persist
 *
 * The auth-scoped `findOne` runs twice by design: once to detect a legacy doc to migrate, then
 * again after migration so the returned conversation always carries the tree shape. Model
 * resolution is left to the caller, which orders it after the per-turn rate/usage guards.
