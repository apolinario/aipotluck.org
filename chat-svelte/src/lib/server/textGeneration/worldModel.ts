/**
 * WORLD-MODEL PRE-PASS (heuristic-override mitigation).
 *
 * The served 8B fails a class of "implicit world-model" turns where a surface cue
 * (a short distance) overrides a physical constraint — the canonical case being
 * *"the car wash is 100m away, should I walk or drive?"* (gold: drive — the car
 * is the thing being washed, so it must be present). On the natural eval set the
 * bare model gets 3/30 of these traps; this pre-pass lifts it to 26/30 with ZERO
 * false-flips on the walk-control turns.
 *
 * Architecture (proven in evals/pragmatics, condition F_reframe2):
 *   SEPARATE the EXTRACT from the JUDGE. The 8B is a competent fact-EXTRACTOR but
 *   a poor direct-JUDGE of this class, so we ask it two NEUTRAL yes/no facts and
 *   let a DETERMINISTIC gate (not the model) decide. The deterministic gate is
 *   what removes the model's judgment — and its false-flips — from the path:
 *   holding the same facts, a model-judge scored 56/65, the gate 61/65.
 *
 * When the gate fires, we INJECT a neutral world-state note into the system
 * prompt (the same mechanism as search grounding / MCP results). The 8B reliably
 * DEFERS to injected facts, so it then phrases the correct answer.
 *
 * GATE, not removal. Default OFF: an unset/typo'd `WORLD_MODEL_PREPASS` resolves
 * to false (no extra call, no behaviour change). Read via Reflect.get because the
 * key isn't in the committed .env — same pattern as MULTIMODAL_ENABLED.

// the car-wash extraction (services_a_vehicle yes→no) on the 8B — the extra text
// distracts a weak model. Prompt parity with the validated condition beats a
// nice-to-have guard here; the extraction only yields two booleans feeding a
// deterministic gate, so a prompt-injection can at most flip walk/drive advice.
