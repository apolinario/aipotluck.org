// Single shared connectivity store for the UI layer. The MVP derives state from
// navigator.onLine + the Network Information API (offline / slow); the heartbeat-fed
// "reconnecting" path stays dormant until the stream watchdog (agent-service's +page.svelte
// seam) feeds it liveness via noteHeartbeat() — at which point a mid-stream stall surfaces
// as "reconnecting" without any change here. One instance so every consumer (the indicator
// component, and later the stream consumer) reads/writes the same store.

 *  and flipped a healthy connection to "reconnecting"/"offline" ~8–20s later. */
